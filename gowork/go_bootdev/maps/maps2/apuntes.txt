Mutations
Insert an Element

m[key] = elem

Get an Element

elem = m[key]

Delete an Element

delete(m, key)

Check If a Key Exists

elem, ok := m[key]

If key is in m, then ok is true and elem is the value as expected.

If key is not in the map, then ok is false and elem is the zero value for the map's element type.

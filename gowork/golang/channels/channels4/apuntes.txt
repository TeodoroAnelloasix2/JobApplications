Buffered Channels

Channels can optionally be buffered.
Creating a Channel With a Buffer

You can provide a buffer length as the second argument to make() to create a buffered channel:

ch := make(chan int, 100)

A buffer allows the channel to hold a fixed number of values before sending blocks. 
This means sending on a buffered channel only blocks when the buffer is full, and receiving blocks only when the buffer is empty.

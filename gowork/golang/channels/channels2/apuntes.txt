Channels

Channels are a typed, thread-safe queue. Channels allow different goroutines to communicate with each other.
Create a Channel

Like maps and slices, channels must be created before use. They also use the same make keyword:

ch := make(chan int)

Send Data to a Channel

ch <- 69

The <- operator is called the channel operator. 
Data flows in the direction of the arrow. 
This operation will block until another goroutine is ready to receive the value.
Receive Data from a Channel

v := <-ch

This reads and removes a value from the channel and saves it into the variable v. 
This operation will block until there is a value in the channel to be read.

Blocking and Deadlocks

A deadlock is when a group of goroutines are all blocking so none of them can continue. 
This is a common bug that you need to watch out for in concurrent programming.
